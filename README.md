4. The Media class is set to a virtual type since we want to use polymorphism of heritage to generalize the usage of the play method. This method is thus virtual. We need to override the method in the inherited classes.
The method is declared at the header of each class so there is no need to modify makefile.
Obs.: Since the Media class is virtual, Media objects can't be instantiated.
Obs2.: video.cpp and photo.cpp were added to the Makefile
